The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, 
but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. 
If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.
For example:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print (i)
    
    
    --
    
 from collections import defaultdict

positions = defaultdict(list)

n, m = map(int,input().split())
for pos in range(1,n+1):
    positions[input()].append(pos)
for _ in range(m):
    print(*positions.get(input(), [-1]))
